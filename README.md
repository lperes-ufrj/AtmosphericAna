===============================================

Module of Atmospheric Neutrino Analysis in DUNE 

It started to be developed at v39_00_00 of dunetpc repository, but it should work fine with newest versions.

The goal of this module is to provide a series of reconstructed variables that can be used in a Boosted decision tree analysis in order to obtain a NC/CC classification of the events and study the directionality of the original atmospheric neutrino.
